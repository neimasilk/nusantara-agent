  "notes": "NORMALIZATION NOTE: Original ballot had 'hold'→'abstain' (P1, P4), 'agent_id'→'agent', 'proposals'→'votes' (object→array). Original had 3 top risks as blockers — restored from 1 to 3. Kill shot: Complex architecture provides no added value over simple baseline due to (1) router fails on A-priority cases, (2) symbolic verifier inactive, (3) N=24 too small to prove superiority. Counter-plan: Run B1 on N=24, if B1 >= B0, pivot to P2 with rule post-filter."
